                        Did you know that trimming your candle wick can make it last 25% longer? Proper candle care is
                        essential for getting the most out of your Scentoria candles.
                        Always trim the wick to 1/4 inch before each burn and let the wax melt evenly across the
                        surface.
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">
                        Avoid burning candles for more than 4 hours at a time, and always place them on a heat-resistant
                        surface.
                        These simple tips will help your candles burn cleaner, longer, and safer!

                        Choosing the right scent for each room can transform your home's atmosphere. Lavender and
                        vanilla work wonderfully in bedrooms for relaxation,
                        while citrus and mint scents are perfect for kitchens and bathrooms to keep things fresh.

                    <p class="desc">
                        For living rooms, try warm scents like cinnamon or sandalwood to create a cozy, welcoming
                        environment.
                        Study rooms benefit from eucalyptus or coffee scents that help with focus and concentration.

                        Soy wax candles are becoming increasingly popular, and for good reason! Unlike paraffin wax, soy
                        wax is natural, renewable, and eco-friendly.
                        It burns cleaner with less soot, making it better for your health and your home.
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">
                        Soy candles also last longer than traditional candles and hold fragrance better, giving you more
                        value for your money.
                        At Scentoria, all our candles are made with premium soy wax for the best experience possible.
